# Relay Module Documentation

## Overview
A relay module is an essential component for controlling high-power devices using low-voltage signals. It acts as an electrically operated switch, allowing microcontrollers like Arduino to interface with external devices like motors, pumps, and home appliances. This document outlines the features, functionality, and applications of the relay module in the context of the Automatic Water Dispenser project.

## Features
- **Microcontroller Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with Arduino UNO and other microcontroller platforms.
- **Pin Configuration:**
  - **VCC:** Power input (typically 5V).
  - **GND:** Ground.
  - **IN:** Signal input for controlling the relay.
  - **COM:** Common terminal.
  - **NO/NC:** Normally Open/Normally Closed terminals for device connection.
- **Low Voltage Trigger:** Operates with a 5V control signal.
- **Quick Response Time:** Ensures real-time switching of connected devices.
- **LED Indicator:** Displays the relay’s operational status.
- **Isolation:** Provides electrical isolation between the control and power circuits using an optocoupler.

## Working Principle
1. **Control Signal Activation:**
   - A low-voltage control signal is sent from the microcontroller to the relay module's input pin (IN).
   - The control signal energizes an internal electromagnet in the relay.
2. **Switching Mechanism:**
   - The energized electromagnet mechanically moves the switch to connect the Common (COM) terminal to the Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC) terminal.
3. **Device Control:**
   - When the relay is activated, current flows through the connected high-power device, enabling it to operate.

## Relay Module in the Automatic Water Dispenser
### Role
The relay module plays a critical role in automating water dispensing and refilling processes. It interfaces with sensors and the Arduino microcontroller to control the water pump based on real-time conditions.

### Functionality
1. **Water Pump Control:**
   - Activates the pump to dispense water when the IR sensor detects a cup.
   - Deactivates the pump when dispensing is complete.
2. **Refill Mechanism:**
   - Monitors signals from the water level sensor.
   - Refills the container from a larger reservoir when the water level drops below a threshold.

### Key Components
- **Input Signal:** Receives signals from the Arduino based on sensor inputs.
- **Switching Circuit:** Controls the power flow to the water pump.
- **Optocoupler:** Ensures safe operation by isolating the control and power circuits.
