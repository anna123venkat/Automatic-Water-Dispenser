# Water Sensor Documentation

## Overview
The water sensor is a vital component in the "Automatic Water Dispenser" project. It monitors the water level in a container to ensure optimal levels are maintained. By detecting water presence and levels, the sensor provides real-time feedback, enabling automated water dispensing and refilling processes.

## Technical Specifications
### Diagram
A water sensor typically consists of:
1. **Conductive Probes/Electrodes:**
   Detect water presence via conductivity.
2. **Signal Processing Unit:**
   Converts conductivity into analog or digital signals.

### Performance
- **Water Level Detection:**
  Measures water levels based on conductivity changes.
- **Threshold Monitoring:**
  Triggers alerts/actions when water levels drop below a defined threshold.

## Functionality
1. **Water Level Detection:**
   Conductive probes sense water presence.
2. **Signal Processing:**
   Translates water presence into measurable signals.
3. **System Integration:**
   Works with microcontrollers for actions such as pump activation.

## Integration in Automatic Water Dispenser
The water sensor continuously monitors the containerâ€™s water level. When water drops below the threshold:
- A signal activates the refill pump.
- The pump stops when the maximum level is reached.

## Applications
- **Household:**
  Water dispensers, smart appliances.
- **Industrial:**
  Automated water management systems.
- **Agriculture:**
  Irrigation and water conservation systems.
