## IR Sensor Overview
### Key Features:
- **Object Detection:** Detects the presence of objects (e.g., a cup) near the dispenser.
- **Infrared Technology:** Uses an IR LED and photodiode for detection.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides quick response times for seamless operation.

### Specifications:
1. **Power Supply:** 3.3V or 5V.
2. **Output Type:** Digital (HIGH/LOW signal).
3. **Components:**
   - IR Emitter: Emits infrared light.
   - Photodetector: Receives reflected light and generates a signal.
4. **Pin Configuration:**
   - VCC: Power input.
   - GND: Ground connection.
   - OUT: Digital output for detection.

## Functionality
### Working Principle:
1. **IR Emission:** The IR LED emits infrared light.
2. **Reflection Detection:** The photodetector senses the reflected light when an object is placed within range.
3. **Signal Generation:** The sensor outputs a LOW signal if an object is detected and a HIGH signal otherwise.

### System Behavior:
- **Default State:** IR sensor continuously emits light and awaits detection.
- **Triggered State:** Upon detecting an object, it sends a signal to the Arduino microcontroller to activate the water pump.

## Integration with System
### Circuit Connection:
1. Connect the IR sensor’s VCC to the Arduino’s 5V pin.
2. Connect the GND to the Arduino’s ground.
3. Connect the OUT pin to a designated digital input pin on the Arduino (e.g., Pin 2).

### Arduino Code Snippet:
```cpp
const int irSensorPin = 2; // Pin connected to the IR sensor
const int pumpRelayPin = 8; // Pin connected to the pump relay

void setup() {
  pinMode(irSensorPin, INPUT); // Set IR sensor pin as input
  pinMode(pumpRelayPin, OUTPUT); // Set pump relay pin as output
  digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, LOW); // Initialize pump OFF
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
}

void loop() {
  int irSensorValue = digitalRead(irSensorPin); // Read IR sensor

  if (irSensorValue == LOW) { // Object detected
    digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, LOW); // Activate pump
    Serial.println("Dispensing Water");
  } else {
    digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, HIGH); // Deactivate pump
    Serial.println("Pump OFF");
  }

  delay(500); // Delay for stability
}
```
