# Objectives of the Automatic Water Dispenser Project

The "Automatic Water Dispenser" project aims to eliminate manual intervention while ensuring optimal water usage and reliable operation. The following objectives outline the key goals of the project:

1. **Automated Dispensing System**:
   - Design and implement a system that uses an IR sensor to detect the need for dispensing water, providing hands-free operation.

2. **Water Level Monitoring**:
   - Utilize a water level sensor to continuously monitor the water levels in the container and trigger the refilling process when levels drop below a specified threshold.

3. **Efficient Water Pump Control**:
   - Develop a water pump control mechanism that efficiently transfers water from a larger reservoir to the smaller container, preventing overflow and ensuring consistent water availability.

4. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Minimize water wastage by implementing precise, real-time control over the dispensing and refilling processes.

5. **Cost-Effective Design**:
   - Provide an economical and scalable solution suitable for a wide range of applications, from households to industrial and agricultural use cases.

6. **Practical Demonstration**:
   - Showcase the systemâ€™s functionality through practical implementation, emphasizing its seamless integration and reliability in real-world scenarios.

7. **Future Adaptability**:
   - Lay the foundation for future enhancements such as remote monitoring capabilities, advanced sensor integration, and cloud-based control systems.
