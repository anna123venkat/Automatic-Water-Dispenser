# Abstract

The **Automatic Water Dispenser** is an IoT-enabled system designed to automate the process of water dispensing and refilling, ensuring optimal resource management and minimal manual intervention. This system integrates various sensors, including an IR sensor for detecting the need for dispensing water and a water level sensor for real-time monitoring of container levels. 

When the water level in the container drops below a predefined threshold, the system triggers a pump to refill the container from a larger reservoir. Similarly, the IR sensor automates the dispensing process by detecting the placement of a container or cup, activating the pump as needed. 

The system leverages an Arduino Uno microcontroller for efficient data processing and control. It incorporates essential hardware components like a relay module, motor pump, and water containers to achieve seamless operation. The software implementation is developed using the Arduino IDE, facilitating easy customization and scalability.

This project addresses the challenges of water management by minimizing wastage, reducing manual effort, and offering a cost-effective, scalable solution suitable for various applications, including household, industrial, and agricultural systems. Future enhancements, such as remote monitoring and advanced sensor integrations, further highlight its potential for modern water management systems.
